# Music Project
Examples of the output of the Music Transformer can be found in the examples_base and examples_cherry_picked. Where the cherry picked examples are some of the best output we heard come from the transformer, while the base exampes are just regular examples of music generation for each of the classes. Note, the musical genre interpolation example is found in the cherry picked folder. The Datasets and full models are not revealed here due to size restrictions. Also we'd like to thank music-autobot for the help converting midi files to readable format.
Note that each of the examples in the cherry picked folder have themes consistent with their genre. EDM has repetitinon of similar pitches with varying rhythm, Jazz has a lot of seventh and ninth chords, and Classical has more complicated melodic structures such as arpegios.
